<h2 align="center">About Us ℹ</h2>
We are a group of 2nd year Computer Science students tasked to design a prototype for an application that implements good UI and UX design for our Human-Computer Interaction subject. We decided to make a prototype for an app that allows users to monitor and interact with the city's water services provider, Davao City Water District (DCWD).

<h2 align="center">Logo Design Philosophy 💡</h2>
The design choices reflect the core values and identity of our team. The gradient of aqua and teal shades represents calmness, adaptability, and clear thinking—qualities we aim to embody in our collaboration. A deep blue background provides strong contrast and depth, while also conveying trust and professionalism. The circular swirl motif symbolizes unity, continuous improvement, and the natural rhythm of teamwork. Integrating a droplet into the “O” of “Flow” reinforces our water-inspired theme and strengthens the visual identity. For typography, we chose a smooth, rounded font to convey friendliness and cohesion, with balanced lettering that ensures clarity while maintaining a sleek, modern aesthetic.
